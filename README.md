## Kaggle Certificates

Kaggle is a data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC. Kaggle enables users to find and publish datasets, explore and build models in a web-based data science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

The certificates on this website were issued by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) through the [Kaggle Learn Program](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). The courses took approximately **29 hours** to complete and the link to my profile is: [jesusgraterol](https://www.kaggle.com/jesusgraterol)
